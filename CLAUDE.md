## Project Overview

Platform — a Kubernetes platform for running AI agent harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) in isolated environments with credential injection, network isolation, and scheduled execution.

### Monorepo layout

pnpm workspaces + standalone Go module. Concept depth lives in [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/).

## Workflow

mise is the task runner. All tasks are defined in `tasks.toml` files. **Always use `mise run` for building, checking, testing, and cluster operations — never invoke `go`, `pnpm`, `helm`, `kubectl`, etc. directly.** mise manages tool versions and environment; running tools directly will break. `mise tasks` lists everything available.

For the local k3s cluster (lima), e2e test runs, and mesh/cert failures, use the [`cluster-ops`](.claude/skills/cluster-ops/SKILL.md) skill.

## System Architecture (what this system is)

Platform-specific. **Always** start from [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) to understand the system. Before changing behavior in any subsystem, you **must** read its architecture page. Do not infer the architecture from the code alone — the architecture pages are the source of truth.

ADRs (`docs/adrs/`) are human-first decision history; the agent-facing source of truth is the architecture docs. Agents read ADRs only when authoring a new ADR (via the `/adr` skill) or recompiling docs. Ordinary work (implementing, understanding the current system) uses the architecture docs, never the ADR log. Never link or reference an ADR from code or documentation.

## TypeScript Engineering (how to write TS here)

Generic conventions for TS server-side code (tRPC, Zod, RxJS, layering). Invoke the `/typescript-engineering` skill whenever touching server-side TS. If you spot a contradiction between the skill and a Platform architecture doc, **stop and flag it** — the two should stay aligned, so a conflict means one of them is wrong.

## Documentation

Always follow [`docs/guidelines/documentation-guidelines.md`](docs/guidelines/documentation-guidelines.md).

## Work process

Proposed ideal flow for new features — see [`docs/guidelines/work-process.md`](docs/guidelines/work-process.md).

## Commit Conventions

- **Conventional Commits**: `type(scope): short summary` — types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `revert`, `style`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`.
- **Scope**: Optional but encouraged (e.g., `feat(ui):`, `fix(hook):`, `docs(design):`).
- **Body**: Optional concise bullet points for non-trivial changes.
- **Trailer**: Configured via `.claude/settings.json` `attribution` — do not add manually.
- **DCO**: Always use `git commit -s` to add `Signed-off-by` trailer.
- **Branch naming**: `type/short-description` (e.g., `feat/session-history`, `fix/stale-timer`). Same type prefixes as commits.

## Branding

Never hardcode the brand (`Dam`, `dam`, or any replacement) in code. The codename `platform` is permanent; user-visible brand flows through Helm `brand.*` ([`deploy/helm/platform/values.yaml`](deploy/helm/platform/values.yaml)) → api-server `config.brand` → UI `getBrand()` ([`packages/ui/src/brand.ts`](packages/ui/src/brand.ts)).

## Worktrees

Use `.worktrees/` for git worktrees. Branch naming follows commit conventions (e.g., `feat/session-history`).

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
